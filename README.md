## Must Know Operations
> in this section, I'll be going over the **must know mathematical concepts** that one must grasp to *understand the functionality of this ray tracer*.
### The Nature of Vectors
**Three-dimensional (3D) vectors** are mathematical entities used to represent quantities that have both ***magnitude*** and ***direction*** in three-dimensional space. They are fundamental in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other areas of science and mathematics.

### Vector Dot Products
**The dot product**, also known as the scalar product, is an operation that takes two **3D vectors** and produces **a scalar** (single numerical value) as its result. The dot product is used to determine the similarity or alignment of two vectors and provides information about ***the angle*** between them. Here's how to calculate the dot product of two 3D vectors, typically denoted as A and B: 

Given two 3D vectors: 

A = (Ax, Ay, Az) 
B = (Bx, By, Bz) 

The dot product A · B is computed as: A · B = Ax * Bx + Ay * By + Az * Bz

### Vector Cross Products
**The cross product**, also known as the vector product, is an operation that takes two ***3D vectors*** and produces ***a third vector*** as its result. This new vector is **orthogonal (perpendicular)** to both of the original vectors and provides valuable geometric information about their relationship. Here's how to calculate the cross product of two 3D vectors, typically denoted as A and B: 

Given two 3D vectors: 

A = (Ax, Ay, Az) 
B = (Bx, By, Bz) 

The cross product A × B is computed as: 

A × B = (Ay * Bz - Az * By, Az * Bx - Ax * Bz, Ax * By - Ay * Bx)

### Vector Reflection Equation
**The normalized vector reflection equation** is used to calculate the ***direction of a vector*** after it ***reflects off a surface***. This is a common concept in physics, computer graphics, and geometry, especially when dealing with light or objects bouncing off surfaces. The equation involves three main components: an incident vector, a surface normal vector, and the reflected vector.

**Incident Vector (I)**: The incident vector represents ***the initial direction*** of a vector, such as a ray of light or an object's velocity, before it interacts with a surface. The incident vector is typically denoted as **I**. 

**Surface Normal Vector (N)**: The surface normal vector represents ***the direction perpendicular to the surface*** at the point of reflection. It is often denoted as **N**. A surface normal vector is ***always a unit vector***, meaning it has a magnitude of 1, to ensure it represents only the direction. 

**Reflected Vector (R)**: The reflected vector represents ***the direction of the vector*** after it ***reflects*** off the surface. It is often denoted as **R**.

The normalized vector reflection equation is typically expressed as follows: **R** = **I** - 2 * (**I** · **N**) * **N**
